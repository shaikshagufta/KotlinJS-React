//IDEA:"watched" and "unwatched" video lists have the same functionality: they display a list of videos.
// Instead of duplicating their logic, we can turn them into a reusable component instead, and use that component twice.

//The videoList component follows the same pattern as the app component.
// It uses the fc builder function, and contains the code from our unwatchedVideos list.

//We now adjust the class definition of VideoList to make use of the props, which are passed into the fc block
val videoList = fc<VideoListProps> { props ->
    var selectedVideo: Video? by useState(null)
//val videoList = fc<VideoListProps> { props ->
    //useState--instruct the framework to keep track of state across multiple invocations of the function.
    for (video in props.videos) {
        p {
            key = video.id.toString()
//'Key' attribute helps the React renderer figure out what it needs to do when the value of props.videos changes.
// It uses the key to determine which parts of a list need to refresh, and which ones stay the same.
            attrs {
                onClickFunction = {
                    //to assign its value to the selectedVideo variable when the user clicks a video

                    selectedVideo = video
                }
            }
            //When we render the list entry that is currently selected, we need to prepend the triangle.
            if (video == selectedVideo) {
                +"â–¶ "
            }

//For our videoList, we want to add a prop containing the list of videos to be shown.
// To do so, let's define an external interface that holds all the props which can be passed to a videoList component.

    var videos: List<Video>
